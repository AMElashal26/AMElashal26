## Hi, I’m AM Elashal

- Building with Python across automation, data analysis, and data science. Recently exploring context engineering for LLMs and reliable workflows.
- I enjoy turning messy processes into clear, automated systems with measurable impact.
- Open to collaborating on developer tooling, data platforms, and ML workflow automation.

**Links**: [GitHub](https://github.com/AMElashal26)

### Skills
- Languages: Python, SQL, JavaScript/TypeScript (basics)
- Data & ML: Pandas, NumPy, scikit-learn, Jupyter, matplotlib/Altair, notebooks-to-pipelines
- Automation & Workflows: GitHub Actions, Bash, Make, cron, REST APIs
- Cloud & Infra: Docker, Linux, basic AWS
- LLM/Context Engineering: prompt+retrieval patterns, evaluation harnesses, dataset curation

### Highlights
- Automation-first mindset: scripts, reproducible notebooks, and CI for data tasks
- Data pipelines that are observable, testable, and versioned
- Practical ML focused on clear metrics and reliable deployment paths
